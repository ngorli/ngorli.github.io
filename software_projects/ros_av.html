                <h2>ROS Autonomous Vehicle Project</h2>
                <p>To gain some experience working with ROS, I created an autonomous vehicle 
                    capable of navigating around cones. This vehicle used LiDAR to detect objects
                    and a simple swerving algorithm to avoid cones and return back to the path. The simulation
                    environment for this project was set up by The Construct.AI
                        <b>Object Detection</b>
                        <ul>
                            To implement the object detection, the topic capturing the LiDAR was
                            subscribed to. The LiDAR data was divided into three sections: front, 
                            left, and right. The minimum distance in each of these sectors was calculated
                            to detect the closest objects to it. If an object was detected within the minimum
                            distance for the front LiDAR, the swerve mechanism would then be implemented.
                            The swerving mechanism worked by comparing the minimum distances in the left and 
                            right direction to see which side had space to swerve to. The wheel angle was then changed
                            for a given duration of time to copmlete a swerve, before having a mirrored wheel
                            angle to move back to the initial trajectory. This series of controls allowed the car to 
                            detect and avoid objects in its path.
                        </ul>
                        <b>Autonomous Driving Commands using a Control Area Network</b>  
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The autonomous driving for this project used the dbw_mkz_msgs package which included
                                the braking, throttle, steering and gear topics used for control. The drive-by-wire
                                system was first enabled before the publication of topics began. Then the different    
                                topics were published to, implementing the logic that was outlined in the prior section. 
                                This allowed the car to drive forward and slow down as it approached objects, before
                                adjusting steering angles to swerve around objects. To simulate a safety mechanism, a 
                                dead mans switch protocol was also incorporated. By having a minimum input rate of 5Hz, 
                                the vehicle would stop responindg to commands if a command was not received at this rate,
                                handling any glitches or mistakes in the driving system.
