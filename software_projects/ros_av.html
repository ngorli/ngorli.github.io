                <h2>ROS Autonomous Vehicle Navigation</h2>
                <p>Autonomous Vehicle Navigation with ROS
                    To gain hands-on experience with the Robot Operating System (ROS), I 
                    developed an autonomous vehicle capable of navigating around cones using 
                    advanced sensor data and control algorithms. This vehicle leveraged LiDAR 
                    for object detection and a swerving algorithm to avoid obstacles while 
                    maintaining its path. The simulation environment for this project was set up 
                    by The Construct.AI, providing a realistic platform for testing and refinement.
                    <li>
                        <b>Object Detection</b>
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                            The main functionality of the object detection system involved subscribing to the LiDAR data 
                            topic. The LiDAR data was segmented into three distinct sections: front, left, and right. 
                            For each section, the minimum distance to the nearest object was calculated. This allowed 
                            the vehicle to detect objects in its immediate vicinity and respond accordingly.
                            When an object was detected within the minimum distance of the front LiDAR, a swerving mechanism was 
                            activated. This mechanism compared the minimum distances on the left and right sides to 
                            determine which direction had sufficient space for maneuvering. The steering angle was adjusted 
                            accordingly to perform the swerve, and after a predefined duration, the wheels were realigned to 
                            return to the original trajectory. This approach ensured that the vehicle could effectively detect 
                            and avoid obstacles while continuing on its path.
                        </ul>
                        <li>
                        <b>Autonomous Driving Commands Using a Control Area Network (CAN)</b>  
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                For autonomous driving control, the project utilized the dbw_mkz_msgs package, 
                                which included topics for braking, throttle, steering, and gear control. 
                                The drive-by-wire system was first enabled before publishing commands to these topics. 
                                The logic implemented for object detection and avoidance, as described previously, was 
                                integrated into the control commands to enable the vehicle to navigate forward, 
                                decelerate upon approaching obstacles, and adjust steering angles to swerve around them. 
                                In addition to basic driving commands, a safety mechanism was incorporated to ensure 
                                reliable operation. A "Dead Man's Switch" protocol was implemented to simulate a fail-safe 
                                system. This protocol required a minimum input rate of 5Hz; if commands were not received 
                                at this rate, the vehicle would stop responding to inputs, handling potential glitches or 
                                errors in the driving system.
