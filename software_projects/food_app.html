                <h2>Recipe Sharing Social Media App</h2>
                <p>For my senior group project in Computer Science, my team and I developed NENA, 
                    a social media application designed for sharing and discovering recipes. The app 
                    was built using Firebase and React Native, providing a platform for users to 
                    express their culinary creativity. With NENA, users can upload and share recipes, 
                    view others' recipes, search for recipes, and connect with friends.
                    <li>
                        <b>Overview</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>NENA aims to provide a dynamic and engaging environment for 
                                users to showcase their cooking skills and explore new recipes. 
                                The app allows users to:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Share Recipes:</b> Upload and display their favorite recipes.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>View Recipes:</b> Browse recipes shared by others on their friends feed.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Search Recipes:</b> Find specific recipes using search functionality.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Add Friends:</b> Connect with other users and interact through the app.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <b>Backend Development</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In the backend, I focused on setting up the database structure in 
                                Firebase and implementing essential functions. The backend architecture 
                                includes:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>User Collection:</b> Each user has fields for date of birth 
                                        (DOB), cooking level (selectable from predefined levels), 
                                        dietary restrictions, email address, first and last names, 
                                        friends list, friend requests, pending requests, passwords, 
                                        user IDs, and profile picture URL.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Recipes Collection:</b> Each recipe entry contains lists 
                                        for ingredients and instructions, public visibility status, 
                                        a description, a picture, a title, a creation timestamp, 
                                        and the associated user ID.
                                    </li>

                                Key tasks I undertook included:
