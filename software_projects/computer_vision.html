                <h2>Computer Vision: Album Cover Genre Classification</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Introduction</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>With the development of music recommendation algorithms, album 
                            covers now have significantly less influence on attracting listeners 
                            compared to the past.</li>
                            <li>Album cover designs have been proven to have strong relationships 
                                to their respective genres (text placement, types of objects, ect.)</li>
                            
                            <li>Discerning features about music through their album covers could 
                            enrich the metrics that music recommendation algorithms currently use.</li>
                            <li>Album cover classification involves not only handling overlapping features 
                            across genres, but also understanding interactions between depicted objects.</li>
                            Previous attempts using SVM, KNN, ResNet, and AlexNet have found 
                            little success due to the complexity of the problem and the use of imbalanced
                            dataset.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Test Fixture Design</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>My first step for designing my test fixtures was to get measurements of all 
                                the relevant parts of the machine and start making some sketches. Then, I 
                                worked on designing models in CAD and iterated on those designs with 
                                feedback from my team until I settled on a final design. Once I had 
                                designed my test fixtures I created dimensioned engineering drawings of 
                                the test fixtures and sent those to the in-house machine shop to have 
                                them manufactured for my testing.
