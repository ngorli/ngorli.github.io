                <h2>Graphics Project: Magical Kitchen</h2>
                <p>
                    This project was done entirely in blender for a computer graphics class. My partner
                    and I were tasked with creating a project depicting any scene, using different 
                    techniques learned in the class. 
                </p>

                    <p>
                    Our image is what we imagine the cartoon magical kitchen of Hermoine Granger from Harry Potter 
                    would look like. To enhance the realism of our scene, we employed two distinct lighting techniques 
                    leveraging Blender's ray tracing capabilities. The first light source is moonlight streaming 
                    through a window on the left. This effect was achieved by positioning a white point light 
                    outside the room at a high angle, allowing it to shine through the window. This creates 
                    reflections on the milk jug, light beams on the opposite wall, and shadows from the metal 
                    pans. Additionally, we incorporated volumetric lighting by applying a volumetric shading 
                    node to simulate the "streaming in" effect seen when light interacts with dust particles 
                    in real life. The second light source is a magical glow emanating from a trail of 
                    magical dust circling the eggs and originating from a wand. The emission from this magical 
                    light reflects off the metal surface of the pot, demonstrating Blender’s capabilities with 
                    ray tracing. </p>
                    <p>
                        The focal point of our image is the three strawberry shortcakes, 
                        each created from scratch. We meticulously UV-mapped the cake layers 
                        and generated their textures procedurally using a series of nodes, 
                        including color ramps, bump maps, noise textures, and texture coordinates. 
                        Additionally, all elements in the scene, including the walls, table, 
                        “Hermione's Kitchen” sign, butter plate, eggs, pots and pans and the bar they hang on, 
                        magic dust, and window pane were created from scratch. Imported assets include the utensils, 
                        wand, and milk jug. Materials such as wood for the wooden objects, marble for the countertop, 
                        and stainless steel for the pots and pans, including their plastic handles, were also imported.

                        My contributions focused on designing the key elements of the scene: the strawberry shortcakes, 
                        eggs, butter and its plate, the background sign, magical dust, and various kitchenware including 
                        the pans and pan rack.
