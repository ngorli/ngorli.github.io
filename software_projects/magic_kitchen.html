                <h2>Graphics Project: Magical Kitchen</h2>
                <p>
                    This project was done entirely in blender for a computer graphics class. My partner
                    and I were tasked with creating a project depicting any scene, using different 
                    techniques learned in the class. Our image is what we imagine the cartoon magical 
                    kitchen of Hermoine Granger from Harry Potter would look like. To leverage the 
                    power of ray tracing, we implemented two different creative light sources. First 
                    we have moon light streaming into the kitchen from the window on the left of the 
                    scene. This was achieved by setting up a white point light outside of the room at 
                    a high angle and then letting that light stream in through the window. You can see 
                    the reflection of the moonlight on the milk jug and the light beam on the opposite 
                    wall as well as the shadow and reflection created by the metal pans on the wall. 
                    The other thing we added was volumetric lighting by adding a volumetric shading 
                    node to the world to capture that “streaming in effect” that is created in real 
                    life when light hits dust in a room. The other creative light source that we used
                    was the light coming from the glowing trail of magical dust that is circling around 
                    the eggs and coming from the wand. The emission glow from the magic light reflects 
                    off of the metal surface of the pot, providing some exciting applications of Blender's 
                    ray tracing. In our image, the main focus is the three strawberry shortcakes. Each 
                    of the cakes was made from scratch. To create the texture of the cake’s layers we 
                    uv mapped them and then added their texture from scratch via procedural generation 
                    with a series of nodes. In particular we used a series of color ramp, bump, noise 
                    texture and texture coordinate nodes.  Additionally, the walls, the table, the 
                    “Hermione's Kitchen” sign, the plate of butter, the eggs, the pots and pans, the 
                    bar where the pots and pans are hanging, the magic dust, and the window pane are 
                    all made from scratch. We imported the utensils, the wand, and the milk jug. The 
                    materials we imported were the wood for all wooden objects, the marble countertop, 
                    and the stainless steel for all of the pots and pans as well as their plastic 
                    handles. My contributions included making the focal objects of the scene: the 
                    strawberry shortcakes, the eggs, the butter and its plate, the sign in the 
                    background, the magic spell dust, the pans, and the pan rack.
