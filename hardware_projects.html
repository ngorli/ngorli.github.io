                    <p>During my summer internship at Cruise, I designed and implemented a 
                        comprehensive tensile strength testing system for evaluating screw 
                        inserts across various materials and configurations. This project 
                        involved creating a custom CAD design for the test fixtures, 
                        running FEA simulations, and conducting physical tests. Python 
                        scripts were developed to analyze and visualize the data, resulting 
                        in a robust dataset that provided critical insights into material 
                        performance for in-house reference. <a href="hardware_projects/tensile_test.html">Learn More</a></p>

                    <p>During my senior year at Stanford, I created a shot glass stand inspired
                        by a collection of shot glasses from around the world. The creation of this stand
                        required several manufacturing processes including milling, brazing, sand casting, 
                        turning on a lathe, sanding, using a wood router, and tapping holes. The final product
                        is a sleek and meaningful display for four shot glasses at a time.

                <div class="institution">
                    <p>For a class project, I had to create a candy dispenser that had rotary motion,
                        was self-resetting, could store multiple candies, and was loadable and dispensable
                        only using one hand. The manufacturing of this project was limited to 3D printing
                        and laser cutting. To execute this, I used a crank and slider mechanism and 3D
                        printed a simple and functional candy dispenser that I designed in CAD.

                    <p>For Stanford Solar Car, I created a telescoping tube actuator. This device 
                        was necessary for locking and unlocking the solar panels on the car so that 
                        they could be adjusted to the most optimal angle during the race to maximize 
                        the amount of sun light received. I had to optimize my design to make it light
                        weight and easy to operate for the user.
