                <h2>Candy Dispenser</h2>
                <p>In a Product Realization course, I undertook a final project to design and create
                    a candy dispenser. The project came with specific design specifications, 
                    presenting both a creative and engineering challenge. The key requirements 
                    for the candy dispenser were:
                    <ul>
                    <l><b>Storage Capacity: </b> Can store up to twenty candies - 
                        the "candies" were plastic spheres, about 1mm in diameter​</l>
                    <l><b>Single-Serve Dispensing: </b>The mechanism should 
                        dispense one candy at a time.</l>
                    <l><b>Automatic Reset: </b>The dispenser should reset automatically 
                        after each use.</l>
                    <l><b>Rotary Motion: </b>Some form of rotary motion needs to be
                    incorporated</l>
                    <l><b>Designated Release Spot: </b> The candy dispenser should have a 
                    designated spot where the candy is released.</l>
                    <l><b>Manufacturing Constraints: </b></l> Components had to be either 
                    3D printed or laser cut.
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Design Process</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        <b>Initial Sketches and Research: </b>
                            <p>
                                The project began with creating initial sketches 
                                of various design concepts. I researched mechanisms 
                                that could incorporate rotary motion and settled on a 
                                crank and slider mechanism. This setup involved turning a 
                                crank to move a slider that would push the candies out 
                                of the machine.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>

                        <b>Rapid Prototyping: </b>
                            <p>
                                I developed early prototypes for the key components:
                                <li>
                                    <b>Candy Holder: </b> Designed to hold up to 20 pieces of candy.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Slider: </b> Responsible for pushing the candy into 
                                    the dispensing hole, with a spring for automatic resetting.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Crank and Slider Mechanism: </b> Translates the rotary 
                                    motion of the crank into the linear motion of the slider.
                                </li>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                                I created a basic 3D model of the candy dispenser in CAD. 
                                Based on prototype testing, I refined the design by modifying 
                                the candy holder to a funnel shape and added a base and candy 
                                catcher at the end of the chute.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <b>Functional Prototype: </b>

                                The next step involved creating a functional prototype, 
                                with some parts manufactured from rapid prototyping 
                                materials and others from final materials. This allowed 
                                me to test and adjust the functionality of the dispenser.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>
                                I modeled the entire assembly in CAD and proceeded to 
                                3D print all the components. Once printed, I assembled 
                                the candy dispenser and tested its functionality to ensure 
                                it met all design specifications.
                            </p>

                                For the final documentation, I created an engineering 
                                drawing for one of the components and an exploded Bill 
                                of Materials (BOM) to detail the assembly process and parts used.
