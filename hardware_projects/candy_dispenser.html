                <h2>Candy Dispenser</h2>
                <p>In my Introduction to Product Realization course, the final project was to 
                    make a candy dispenser. There were a few design specifications that had to 
                    be met for the project which added some additional challenge:
                    <l>Can store up to twenty candies - The "candies" were plastic spheres, about 1mm in diameter​</l>
                    <l>Dispense the candies one at a time</l>
                    <l>Reset set itself automatically</l>
                    <l>Have some form of rotary motion</l>
                    <l>Candies must have a designated release spot</l>
                    <l>Components had to be 3D printed or laser cut</l>
                    I started this project by making some initial sketches of potential ideas. 
                    I also had to research how I wanted to incorporate a mechanism that used 
                    rotary motion. I decided on using a crank and slider, where the user would 
                    turn the crank, and the slider would push the candies out of the machine. I 
                    worked then to create early rapid prototypes of the the key components of my 
                    machine:
                    <l>The candy holder, which would need to be able to hold 20 pieces of candy</l>
                    <l>The slider, which pushes candy into a hole for dispensing, with a spring 
                    attached to it for resetting.</l>
                    <l>The crank and slider, which will translate the rotary motion of the crank 
                    into the linear motion of the slider.</l>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    Next, I worked to create a basic 3D model of my candy dispenser in CAD. After 
                    prototype testing, I decided to make the candy holder more of a funnel shape, 
                    and added in the base and candy catcher at the end of the chute as well.

                    The next step in the design process was to create a functional prototype, 
                    where some of the parts were manufactured and some of the parts were still 
                    made from the rapid prototyping materials.

            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    After this I modeled the entire assembly in CAD so that I could begin 
                    3D printing my components.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    After creating 3D printing all of the components I assembled the candy machine. 
                    Then I tested my entire candy machine for its functionality. I also had to create
                    an engineering drawing for one of my components and an exploded BOM. This project 
                    was successful as I was able to create a fully functional candy machine that met 
                    all of the design specifications.
