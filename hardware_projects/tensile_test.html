                <h2>Tensile Test Fixture</h2>
                <p>During my summer internship at Cruise in 2023, I was tasked with a 
                    project involving tensile strength testing of various assemblies. 
                    The objective was to evaluate different materials, inserts, and screws 
                    to understand their performance under stress. To conduct these tests, 
                    I would be using an Instron machine to pull on the 
                    assembly until failure. The project consisted of the following phases:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Test Design</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each test configuration required running 5 repetitions to 
                                ensure reliability. The test samples were small cubes of material,
                                 with an insert installed on one face and a screw threaded into the 
                                 insert. These assemblies had to be securely held in place while 
                                 being attached to the Instron machine for tensile testing.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A challenge arose because the screws did not easily interface with the 
                                Instron machine head. Thus, it was essential to design a fixture to 
                                both hold the assembly and interface with the machine. This led to the 
                                next phase of the project: designing the test fixtures.
                            </li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Materials:</b> Aluminum and Polypropylene
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Inserts:</b> Helicoils, Keenserts, and a tapped hole as a control
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Screws</b> M4 and M6 screws, both 100mm in length
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Test Fixture Design</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The fixture design process began with obtaining measurements of the 
                                Instron machine and creating initial sketches. I then developed CAD 
                                models of the fixtures, iterating on these designs based on feedback 
                                from my team. The final designs were detailed in engineering drawings, 
                                which were sent to the in-house machine shop for manufacturing.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Test Simulations</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Before running physical tests, I performed FEA simulations on the 
                                designed fixtures. These simulations were crucial to ensure the 
                                fixtures could withstand the stresses encountered during testing 
                                and to predict the performance of the samples under load.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Running the Tests</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>With the test fixtures manufactured and materials prepared, 
                                I proceeded to conduct the tensile tests. Each test was set up 
                                by configuring the Instron machine, gradually increasing the force 
                                applied to the samples, and recording the resulting data.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Data Analysis</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Instron machine provided test data in CSV format, 
                                capturing force and displacement every two milliseconds. 
                                The volume of data â€” tens of thousands of samples per test - required an 
                                automated approach to analysis. I wrote a Python script utilizing NumPy to 
                                parse the CSV files and calculate the average maximum force for each test 
                                configuration. This automation significantly streamlined the analysis process.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Below are images of the test fixtures I designed, the Instron machine 
                    used for the tests, and some of the test samples.
