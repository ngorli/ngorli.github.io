                <h2>Tensile Test Fixture</h2>
                <p>In my 2023 summer internship at Cruise, my main internship project was to 
                    conduct tensile strength testing for different assemblies of materials, inserts and 
                    screws. For this project, I was to test two different materials, two different inserts 
                    and a control tapped hole, two different insert depths, and two different screw 
                    lengths. To conduct these tests, I would be using an Instron machine to pull on the 
                    assembly until failure. The project consisted of the following phases:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Test Design</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>First I had to decide how I wanted to run my tests. For each of the 
                                configurations I ran 5 tests of each. Each material would be a small cube, 
                                with the insert installed into one face, and the screw screwed into the 
                                insert. From there, each of these assemblies would need to be held in 
                                place, with the screw attached to the Intron machine so they could be 
                                pulled apart. However, the screws would not easily interface with the head 
                                of the Intron machine, and some fixture would also be needed to hold the 
                                assembly in place. This leads to the next part of my project, designing the 
                                test fixtures.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Test Fixture Design</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>My first step for designing my test fixtures was to get measurements of all 
                                the relevant parts of the machine and start making some sketches. Then, I 
                                worked on designing models in CAD and iterated on those designs with 
                                feedback from my team until I settled on a final design. Once I had 
                                designed my test fixtures I created dimensioned engineering drawings of 
                                the test fixtures and sent those to the in-house machine shop to have 
                                them manufactured for my testing.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Test Simulations</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Once I had designed parts, I decided to run FEA simulations of the parts 
                                to know if they were both resilient enough for my tests and to get an idea 
                                of how my samples would perform when I run my tests.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Running the Tests</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Once I had all of my test fixtures and I had ordered all of the materials 
                                needed for my test samples, I then began to run my tests. I set up each 
                                test with the machine and increased the force, recording test data as I 
                                went.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Data Analysis</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The machine output all of the test data as csv files, sampling force and 
                                displacement every two milliseconds. In each of these files, there were 
                                tens of thousands of samples, resulting in an overwhelming amount of 
                                data to be analyzed. To speed up this process, I decided to write a Python 
                                script to automate my data analysis. I imported NumPy to parse the csv 
                                files and then wrote code to get the average maximum force for each set 
                                of tests for each configuration.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Below are images of the test fixtures that I designed, the machine that the fixtures 
                    were designed for, and some of the test samples.
