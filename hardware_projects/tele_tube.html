                <h2>Telescoping Tube Actuator</h2>
                <p>During my time with the Stanford Solar Car Project, I was tasked with 
                    designing a telescoping tube actuator. This actuator was crucial for 
                    optimizing the solar array's position during regular stops in the race.
                    The actuator must enable the solar array to be adjusted to maximize energy 
                    absorption by positioning it optimally towards the sun.
                    
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Project Requirements and Specifications</li>
                <ul>
                    <b>Displacement and Tension: </b>
                    <li>The design needed to accommodate 50mm of displacement and 50N of tension, 
                        applied through six Bowden cables.</li>
                    <b>Handheld Operation: </b> 
                    <li>The actuator must be operable by hand, with the ability to 
                        apply tension using one hand.</li>
                    <b>Weight Constraint: </b>
                    <li>The total weight of the actuator should ideally be less than 250g.</li>
                    <b>Bowden Cable Housing: </b>
                    <li>The diameter of the Bowden cable housing is 6mm.</li>
                    <b>Housing Nesting: </b>
                    <li> Holes to nest the end of the cable housings should be approximately 7-10mm deep.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Design Process</li>
                <ul>
                    <b>Design Iterations: </b>
                    <li>I began by iterating through various design ideas using CAD 
                        software. Each design iteration was evaluated based on the project's 
                        specifications and functionality. Feedback from team members was 
                        incorporated to refine and improve the designs. The design process involved 
                        several iterations to address any issues and optimize the actuator's 
                        performance.</li>
                    <b>Hardware Integration: </b>
                    <li>I imported hardware components from McMaster-Carr into the CAD model to 
                        ensure compatibility and functionality. This included selecting appropriate 
                        fasteners and fittings to match the design specifications.</li>
                    <b>Final Design: </b>
                    <li>After numerous iterations and refinements, the final design was settled 
                        upon. The actuator featured an efficient displacement mechanism and a 
                        compact, lightweight design. The CAD model accurately represented the 
                        final design, and the hardware components from McMaster-Carr were integrated 
                        to ensure the actuator met all requirements.</li>                     
                </ul>
                </ul>
