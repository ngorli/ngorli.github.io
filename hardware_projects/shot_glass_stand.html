                <h2>Shot Glass Stand</h2>
                <p>For my design and manufacturing class, I had to create something using at least two core 
                    manufacturing processes. This project was supposed to be something unique, and something with
                    meaningful to us. Whenever I travel, I collect a shot glass for the city I am in, so that I
                    have something to rememver the ciytu that I was in, and because it usually has artwork that 
                    is relevant to the cultural history of the city. So, I decided to make a shot glass stand that
                    had a globe as the centerpiece. Below, I will outline all the different steps in the creation
                    of this project.

                        <ul>
                            <li>The first part of my project was to create design sketches. I made very rough 
                                annoatead sketches of what I loosely wanted the project to look like. Those
                                sketches are shown below.

                            <li>After going through a sketching phase, I next designed some rough rapid prototypes
                                to get a better physical representation of what the project would look like. 
                                For the rapid protoype, I used pins and cotton balls to represent the rubber feet 
                                at the base of the stand. I used pink foam for the base and for the globe. I used pipe 
                                cleaners as the rods for the platforms, and cut the bottoms of small plastic cups to 
                                create the platform base. These were connected with tape. I creaetd the globe by cutting 
                                up and gluing pink foam to resemble a semi-spherical shape. Finally, I attached all of these
                                components to create my prototype.

                            <li>Before manufacturing my project in the lab, I created an operations 
                                sequence outlining the steps I would take to create all of my parts 
                                and assemble them. The operation sequence outlined all of the processes 
                                that follow.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Creating the Base:</b> To create the wooden base, I started with a plank
                                of wood. First, I had to cutout the hole where the globe would sit. To
                                do so, I first laser cut the profile of the circular hole into a thin 
                                piece of wood, which was used as a guide. The shape of the wood would 
                                be 4” x 4” to sit flush with the wooden block. Then, I put the laser cut 
                                piece on top of the block, and taped it down to secure it and used a hand
                                router to cut out a cylindrical hole to a depth of .375”. Finally, I made 
                                the through holes for the screw connecting the globe to the wooden base.
                                I used the drill press, to create two through holes in the bottom of the base 
                                using a ¼-20 drill bit. Then I made a counterbore using a ½-13 drill bit, with
                                a depth 0.2”. Next, I cut out a 3/4" x 4" x 4" block of wood from the 3/4" 
                                x 4" x 12" plank, using the bandsaw. Finally, I sanded the wood and applied 
                                Linseed oil to bring out the color of the walnut wood.

                            <li><b>Creating the Globe:</b> The globe was made from two bronze hemispheres 
                                that were cast and then brazed together. First I had to 3D print an a mold
                                for sand casting the part. I created a modified hemisphere that was that had 
                                drafts allowing me to pull the mold to be pulled out of the sand. Once I successully created two sand molds for the hemisphers, molten
                                bronze was pourded into the molds to create the two hemishperes
                                </div>

                                A lot of post processing work was necessary for the hemispheres to take
                                them from rough cast parts to the globe. The next steps were: tapping holes
                                for the platforms and attachment to the base into the hemispheres. Before I tapped
                                the holes, I had to use an angle grinder, a hand saw, and a belt sander to get rid of the 
                                excess material that was on my parts from imperfections in the sand casting 
                                process. When the excess material was gone, I used the mill to face of my edges
                                and tap the holes.

                            Once all of the holes had created, the next steps in the process were to remove the attachments
                            that had been used for creating the holes and then braze the two hemishperes together. I used the
                            sanding belt to sand down the hemishperes to remove the attachments, and flatten the two faces
                            that would be brazed together. Once this was completed, I used an oxygen torch and low temp
                            bronze to braze them together.

                            Next, the globe needed to be sanded down to a near mirror finish. To do so, I began sanding at
                            40 grit sand paper, and went all the way up to 1500 grit, in icriments of roughly 100, based on
                            what grits of sandpaper were available. The final component of creating the globe after it hand
                            been sanded was to create the patterns of the continents. To do so, I 3d printed thein profiles of
                            the continents. Then I used tape to attache them to the globe. Next, I bead blasted the globe,
                            which resulted in the oceans having a matte finish and the continents having a contrasting
                            mirror finish.

                                aluminium rods, 3/8" in diameter. I cut the rods into 2.75" smaller rods and then used
                                the lathe to create external threads. The threads were 3/8 16 and were 1/4" long. Finally
                                I sanded and bead blasted the rods to give them a matte finish.

                                the circular holes into the top of the platforms. To do so, I first drilled a center hole,
                                wide enough for the boring bar tool on the lathe to get in. Then, using the boring bar I cut 
                                out the center hole into the top of the discs. Then, using the mill, I tapped 3/8 16 holes into
                                the sides of all of the platforms, so that they could be screwed on to the platform rods.
