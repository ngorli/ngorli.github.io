                <h2>Shot Glass Stand</h2>
                <p>For my design and manufacturing class, I had to create something using at least two core 
                    manufacturing processes. This project was supposed to be something unique, and something with
                    meaningful to us. Whenever I travel, I collect a shot glass for the city I am in, so that I
                    have something to rememver the ciytu that I was in, and because it usually has artwork that 
                    is relevant to the cultural history of the city. So, I decided to make a shot glass stand that
                    had a globe as the centerpiece. Below, I will outline all the different steps in the creation
                    of this project.
                </p>

                        <b>Sketches</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The first part of my project was to create design sketches. I made very rough 
                                annoatead sketches of what I loosely wanted the project to look like. Those
                                sketches are shown below.

                        <b>Prototypes</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>After going through a sketching phase, I next designed some rough rapid prototypes
                                to get a better physical representation of what the project would look like. 
                                For the rapid protoype, I used pins and cotton balls to represent the rubber feet 
                                at the base of the stand. I used pink foam for the base and for the globe. I used pipe 
                                cleaners as the rods for the platforms, and cut the bottoms of small plastic cups to 
                                create the platform base. These were connected with tape. I creaetd the globe by cutting 
                                up and gluing pink foam to resemble a semi-spherical shape. Finally, I attached all of these
                                components to create my prototype.

                            <li>The next step in the process was to create a detailed CAD model of the entire
                                assembly of the shot glass stand. I used Fusion 360 to create my design.

                        <b>Operations Sequence</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Before manufacturing my project in the lab, I created an operations 
                                sequence outlining the steps I would take to create all of my parts 
                                and assemble them.
                            </li>
                            <li>Creating the Base: To create the wooden base, I cut out a 3/4" x 4" x 4" 
                                block of wood from the 3/4" x 4" x 12" plank I purchased, using the 
                                bandsaw. Next I had to cutout the hole where the globe would sit. To
                                do so, I first laser cut the profile of the circular hole into a thin 
                                piece of wood, which was used as a guide. The shape of the wood would 
                                be 4” x 4” to sit flush with the wooden block. Then, I put the laser cut 
                                piece on top of the block, and taped it down to secure it and used a hand
                                router to cut out a cylindrical hole to a depth of .375”. Finally, I made 
                                the through holes for the screw connecting the globe to the wooden base.
                                I used the drill press, to create two through holes in the bottom of the base 
                                using a ¼-20 drill bit. Then I made a counterbore using a ½-13 drill bit, with
                                a depth 0.2”.
                            </li>
                            <li>Casting the Globe: The globe was made from two bronze hemispheres that were cast 
                                together.
