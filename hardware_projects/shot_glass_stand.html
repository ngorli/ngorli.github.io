                <h2>Shot Glass Stand</h2>
                <p>For my design and manufacturing class, I had to create something using at least two core 
                    manufacturing processes. This project was supposed to be something unique, and something with
                    meaningful to us. Whenever I travel, I collect a shot glass for the city I am in, so that I
                    have something to rememver the ciytu that I was in, and because it usually has artwork that 
                    is relevant to the cultural history of the city. So, I decided to make a shot glass stand that
                    had a globe as the centerpiece. Below, I will outline all the different steps in the creation
                    of this project.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Test Design</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>First I had to decide how I wanted to run my tests. For each of the 
                                configurations I ran 5 tests of each. Each material would be a small cube, 
                                with the insert installed into one face, and the screw screwed into the 
                                insert. From there, each of these assemblies would need to be held in 
                                place, with the screw attached to the Intron machine so they could be 
                                pulled apart. However, the screws would not easily interface with the head 
                                of the Intron machine, and some fixture would also be needed to hold the 
                                assembly in place. This leads to the next part of my project, designing the 
                                test fixtures.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Sketches</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The first part of my project was to create design sketches. I made very rough 
                                annoatead sketches of what I loosely wanted the project to look like. Those
                                sketches are shown below.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <b>Prototypes</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>After going through a sketching phase, I next designed some rough rapid prototypes
                                to get a better physical representation of what the project would look like. 
                                For the rapid protoype, I used pins and cotton balls to represent the rubber feet 
                                at the base of the stand. I used pink foam for the base and for the globe. I used pipe 
                                cleaners as the rods for the platforms, and cut the bottoms of small plastic cups to 
                                create the platform base. These were connected with tape. I creaetd the globe by cutting 
                                up and gluing pink foam to resemble a semi-spherical shape. Finally, I attached all of these
                                components to create my prototype.
