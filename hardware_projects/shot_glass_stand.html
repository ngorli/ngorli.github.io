                <h2>Shot Glass Stand</h2>
                <p>For my design and manufacturing class, I undertook a project that was required to
                    combine at least two core manufacturing processes to create a unique and 
                    meaningful object. As a traveler who collects shot glasses from each city I visit, 
                    I decided to design a custom shot glass stand with a globe as the centerpiece to 
                    commemorate my travels and highlight the cultural significance of each city’s shot 
                    glass. Below, I outline the steps involved in creating this project.

                        <b>Sketches</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The initial phase involved creating design sketches. I produced 
                                several rough, annotated sketches to visualize the overall concept 
                                and layout of the shot glass stand. These early sketches provided a 
                                foundation for refining the design in subsequent stages.

                                I used various materials to represent different components:

                                        I began with a 4” x 4” wooden plank. Using a laser cutter, 
                                        I cut a circular profile to serve as a guide for a cylindrical 
                                        hole, then used a hand router to cut the hole to a depth of 
                                        0.375”.
                                    </li>

                                        I  drilled two through holes for the screws 
                                        using a drill press and made a counterbore with a 
                                        depth of 0.2”.

                                        I cut a 3/4" x 4" x 4" block from the plank using a 
                                        bandsaw, then sanded the wood and applied Linseed oil 
                                        to enhance the walnut's color.

                                        The molds were designed with drafts to facilitate easy 
                                        removal from the sand.

                                        Molten bronze was poured into the sand molds to create 
                                        the hemispheres.

                                        The rough cast hemispheres were cleaned using an angle 
                                        grinder, hand saw, and belt sander. Tapped holes were 
                                        added using a mill. The hemispheres were then brazed 
                                        together using an oxygen torch and low-temp bronze.

                                        mirror finish. Continental patterns were added using 3D-printed
                                        profiles and bead blasting to achieve contrasting matte and mirror
                                        finishes.
