                    <p>
                        At Stanford, I am involved with the Intelligent and Interactive 
                        Autonomous Systems Group (ILIAD) within Stanford Artificial 
                        Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL), which focuses on developing 
                        algorithms for AI agents to safely and reliably interact with 
                        people. This research encompasses both human-robot interaction and human-AI interaction. 
                        During my undergraduate research with the lab, I participated in a joint project with 
                        the Toyota Research Institute (TRI). The project had two main objectives:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <b>Skill Segmentation in Driving: </b> Train a model to 
                                identify and teach driving skills. The model used in this
                                project was developed by my co-researcher for this project 
                                Megha Srivastava in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14003">this paper</a>, 
                                on the data I had collected.

                            <li>
                                <b>Interaction with Semi-Autonomous Driving Systems: </b>  Educating 
                                users on how to interact with and work with semi-autonomous driving 
                                systems.
                            </li>

                                <b>CARLA Simulation Setup - Parallel Parking Demonstrations:</b>
                                <ol>
                                    <b>Environment Setup: </b> I explored various CARLA maps 
                                    to identify a suitable location for parallel parking 
                                    demonstrations. I set up the simulation to include two 
                                    dummy cars for the parking scenario and created an ego car 
                                    for controlled demonstrations.
                                </ol>
                                <ol>
                                    <b>Data Collection: </b> Data collection was configured to 
                                    record states and actions at 15 timestamps per second. The 
                                    recorded states included x, y position, and rotation angle, 
                                    while the actions recorded were throttle, brake, steer, and 
                                    gear (forward or reverse). Approximately 75 samples were 
                                    collected for training the model.
                                </ol>

                                            <b>Track Setup: </b> A  basic map was used as a rudimentary 
                                            race track for the racing demonstrations. The setup was similar 
                                            to that of the parallel parking simulation.

                                            about 75 samples collected for the racing scenario.

                                    <li>
                                        I parsed the collected data to prepare it 
                                        for model training. I had to create trajectory with rewards 
                                        objects importing the imitation library to use with 
                                        tensorflow and convert them to .pkl files to be used with the 
                                        models. Through hyperparameter sweeps, I successfully achieved 
                                        skill segmentation for the racing example. The results from 
                                        this segmentation are now being utilized in the ongoing 
                                        research for this project.
