                        At Stanford, I am part of the  Intelligent and Interactive Autonomous Systems 
                        Group (ILIAD). The lab focuses on developing algorithms for AI agents that safely and reliably interact with people, for both human-robot interaction and human-AI interaction. As an undegraduate researcher with the lab, the project I have worked on has been a joint project with Toyota Research Institute (TRI). The project has two main goals: 1. Using a skill segmentatio algorithm to 
                        identify skills in driving and teach people how to drive. 2. Teaching people
                        how to use and work with semi-autonomous driving systems. My tasks first
                        consisted of setting up a simulation in CARLA to collect driving demonstrations
                        for parallel parking and naive racing scenarios. Then I had train the skill segmoneter model, compILE, developed by my co-researcher for this project Megha Srivastava in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14003"></a>this paper</a>, on the data I had collected.

                                <b>CARLA Simulation:</b>
                                For my work in the CARLA simulation, I had to set up two different environments. The first environment I created was to give parallel parking demonstrations. First I needed to go through the different CARLA maps and find a suitable location for the demonstrations. Next, 
                                I set up the simulation two spawn two dummy cars for the parallel parking simulation, and then created an ego car I would control for demonstration. Finally, I set up data collectiion to record my states and actions at every timestamp - 15 times a second - to be passed into the model for training. The states consisted of x, y position and rotation angle and the actions were throttle, break, steer, and gear (forward or reverse). I collected about 75 samples to be used for training compILE. Below are some images of what the demonstrations looked like.

                            <div class="text">  
                            For the racing demonstrations, the below map was used as a rudimentary race track. The set up was the same as parallel parking and the same values were used for the state action pairings. Once again, about 75 samples were collected.

                                <b>compILE Training:</b>
                                Once all of the data had been collected, I then had to parse all of the data I had collected and tune the hyper paramemters of the compILE model to get successful skill segmentation. I did sweeps over the various hyperparameters the model took in and was succussfel in finding skill segmentation for the racing example. The results from this skill segmentation are now being used in the continuation of work in this project.
