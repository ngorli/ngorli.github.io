                        At Stanford, I am part of the  Intelligent and Interactive Autonomous Systems 
                        Group (ILIAD). The lab focuses on developing algorithms for AI agents that safely and reliably interact with people, for both human-robot interaction and human-AI interaction. As an undegraduate researcher with the lab, the project I have worked on has been a joint project with Toyota Research Institute (TRI). The project has two main goals: 1. Using a skill segmentatio algorithm to 
                        identify skills in driving and teach people how to drive. 2. Teaching people
                        how to use and work with semi-autonomous driving systems. My tasks first
                        consisted of setting up a simulation in CARLA to collect driving demonstrations
                        for parallel parking and naive racing scenarios. Then I had train the skill segmoneter model, compILE, developed by my co-researcher for this project Megha Srivastava in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14003">this paper</a>, on the data I had collected.
